We are extremely proud to have been accepted as an organization for Google Summer of Code 2022 (GSoC'22), a global online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.
GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization, such as Unikraft, on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

If you're interested in applying, please check out [our GSoC webpage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/unikraft) and please don’t hesitate to join [our Discord server](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord) and ask us questions directly.
We are more than happy to discuss potential projects beyond the ones listed on the GSoC webpage.
Also be sure to check out [our website](https://unikraft.org) for general information about Unikraft, and try out the previous [student tutorials and exercises](https://usoc21.unikraft.org/docs/sessions/schedule/) to get more familiar with the project.
We’re looking forward to speak with you and receiving your applications!
