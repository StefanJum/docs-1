## Challenge Description

You are given an executable.
Run it, find out what it does and find a way to retrieve the flag.

{{% alert theme="info" %}}
Hint: All you need to know is in the executable file.
{{% /alert %}}

If everything goes well, the output of the executable will look like this:

```console
$ ./main
[...]
USoC{...}
```

Copy the flag (`USoC{...}`) and paste it in the [registration form](https://forms.gle/Lz3DqefrnfxWFMCB8).
